Ten little Soldier boys went out to dine;    
One choked his little self and then there were nine.    
Nine little Soldier boys sat up very late;  
One overslept himself and then there were eight.  
Eight little Soldier boys traveling in Devon;  
One said heâ€™d stay there and then there were seven.  
Seven little Soldier boys chopping up sticks;  
One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.  
Six little Soldier boys playing with a hive;  
A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.  
Five little Soldier boys going in for law;  
One got into Chancery and then there were four.  
Four little Soldier boys going out to sea;  
A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.  
Three little Soldier boys walking in the zoo;  
A big bear hugged one and then there were two.  
Two little Soldier boys playing with a gun;  
One shot the other and then there was One.  
One little Soldier boy left all alone;  
He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.

A masterpiece in the world of suspense by Agatha Christie. If you love detective and suspense stories, this book is definitely worth reading. There are no flaws or plotholes that I can mention. There have been many movie and TV adaptations, but the book deserves to be read. Anything more that I mention will give away some story or would spoil the fun of reading it. Go and have the experience for yourself.
