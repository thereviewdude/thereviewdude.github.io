The following has be taken from the book [Hardcore Self Help: F\*\*k Anxiety by Robert Duff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23211224-hardcore-self-help), which is a letter to Explain Anxiety to Someone Who Just Doesnâ€™t Get It. I had personally sent this letter to some of my relatives and friends. You can download it as a PDF here, and share it with your peers if needed.
