I call myself TheReviewDude. I just write this blog because I love to share my views on the books I read, and it motivates me to read more. This process makes me think more about the stuff I read and I get to learn more.

For any sort of feedback or comment, feel free to contact me at [thereviewdude@protonmail.com](mailto:thereviewdude@protonmail.com)
