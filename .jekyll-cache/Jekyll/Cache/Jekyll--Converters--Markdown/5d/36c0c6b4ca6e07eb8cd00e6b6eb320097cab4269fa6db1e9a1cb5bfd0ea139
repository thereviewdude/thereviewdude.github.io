I"Ü<p>I am not really a fan of self-help books which tell you what needs to be done without giving you the Scientific reasoning behind it. Most probably because those books expect me to trust and follow their suggestions as if the books are written by God. I had the same skeptical thoughts when I was suggested this book by my psychiatrist. He said it‚Äôll help me in my mental condition. Since I was desperate to get out of my fucked up mind, I decided to give it a go. I have to say, I liked most parts of this book.
TLDR: If you feel you are undergoing some form of mental unrest or illness, I will recommend you to read this book. At least the first few chapters. Don‚Äôt accept the points raised, think about them.</p>

<p>The book contains 10 chapters, and has been written in the form of questions and answers. It‚Äôs like you are asking life questions to your <em>spiritual guru</em> and the author is giving you the enlightenment. To know more about the author, you may head on to his <a href="https://ytprivate.com/channel/UCj9fPezLH1HUh7mSo-tB1Mg">youtube channel</a>, or read his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">wikipedia page</a>.<br />
The book starts with the author asking us to disassociate ourselves from our mind, and that we need to know when to turn off the thinking in our brain. Here‚Äôs a stanza from the book which I found to be quite thought-provoking:

<p>According to Tolle, our brain, just like the other organs needs some rest and after we‚Äôre done with our mental work, we should be able to stop thinking. Here, the words <strong>compulsive thinking</strong> are important in my opinion. If we are doing some assignment, some office work, or trying to solve some life problem, definitely thinking is required. But if we are sitting idle, we should be able to stop thinking. <em>Thinking</em> becomes an addiction for most of us, which is why meditation appears tough. We are unable to clear our head of the <em>compulsive thoughts</em>.</p>

<p>The author also mentions that when we are working on a solution, we oscillate between thoughts. And the gap between two thoughts is being referred to as no-mind.

Thoughts without consciousness are compulsive, and ‚Äúquickly become barren, insane, destructive‚Äù.</p>

<p>As I said, I found it to be quite thought provoking, and we do know that science has proved the importance of meditation keeping our thoughts under control to prevent them from getting too powerful. The author says that birds, animals or trees are not familiar with the concept of calendars and clocks, and the only thing that exists for them is <em>Now</em>, the present moment. Humans have evolved to have a highly functional brain which is capable of planning things ahead, but it‚Äôs about time that humans learnt to switch off the planning mode for some time according to their needs. Now, planning is not bad. It‚Äôs awesome to plan things ahead, but <em>compulsively</em> doing it is bad. We need to evolve our brains such that the brain is under our own control, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>I would have really liked if the author gave some justification to a few of his statements such as the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/thepowerofnow/4.jpg" alt="pain" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/thepowerofnow/2.jpg" alt="anger" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After this, the further chapters become a bit repetetive and a bit too spiritual and revolves around terms like ‚ÄòBeing‚Äô, ‚ÄòUnconscious‚Äô, ‚ÄòLife‚Äô, etc which are not too practical, IMO.</p>
