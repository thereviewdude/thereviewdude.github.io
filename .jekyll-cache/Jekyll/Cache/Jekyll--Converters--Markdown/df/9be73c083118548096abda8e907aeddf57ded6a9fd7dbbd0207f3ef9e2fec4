I"Â<p>I am not really a fan of self-help books which tell you what needs to be done without giving you the Scientific reasoning behind it. Most probably because those books expect me to trust and follow their suggestions as if the books are written by God. I had the same skeptical thoughts when I was suggested this book by my psychiatrist. He said it‚Äôll help me in my mental condition. Since I was desperate to get out of my fucked up mind, I decided to give it a go. I have to say, I liked this book, and will recommend it to other people. Read further to find out my take on this book.</p>

<p>The book contains 10 chapters, and has been written in the form of questions and answers. It‚Äôs like you are asking life questions to your <em>spiritual guru</em> and the author is giving you the enlightenment. To know more about the author, you may head on to his <a href="https://ytprivate.com/channel/UCj9fPezLH1HUh7mSo-tB1Mg">youtube channel</a>, or read his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">wikipedia page</a>.<br />
The book starts with the author asking us to disassociate ourselves from our mind, and that we need to know when to turn off the thinking in our brain. Here‚Äôs a stanza from the book which I found to be quite thought-provoking:

<p>According to Tolle, our brain, just like the other organs needs some rest and after we‚Äôre done with our mental work, we should be able to stop thinking. Here, the words <strong>compulsive thinking</strong> are important in my opinion. If we are doing some assignment, some office work, or trying to solve some life problem, definitely thinking is required. But if we are sitting idle, we should be able to stop thinking. <em>Thinking</em> becomes an addiction for most of us, which is why meditation appears tough. We are unable to clear our head of the <em>compulsive thoughts</em>.</p>

<p>The author also mentions that when we are working on a solution, we oscillate between thoughts. And the gap between two thoughts is being referred to as no-mind.

Thoughts without consciousness are compulsive, and ‚Äúquickly become barren, insane, destructive‚Äù</p>
