<p>A masterpiece in the world of suspense by Agatha Christie. If you love detective and suspense stories, this book is definitely worth reading. There are no flaws or plotholes that I can mention. There have been many movie and TV adaptations, but the book deserves to be read. Anything more that I mention will give away some story or would spoil the fun of reading it. Go and have the experience for yourself.</p>
