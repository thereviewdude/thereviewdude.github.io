I"î<p>The following has be taken from the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23211224-hardcore-self-help">Hardcore Self Help: F**k Anxiety by Robert Duff</a>, which is a letter to Explain Anxiety to Someone Who Just Doesnâ€™t Get It. I had personally sent this letter to some of my relatives and friends. You can download it as a PDF here, and share it with your peers if needed.
