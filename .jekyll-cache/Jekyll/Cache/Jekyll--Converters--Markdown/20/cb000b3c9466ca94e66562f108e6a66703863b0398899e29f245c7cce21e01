I"~<p>I am not really a fan of self-help books which tell you what needs to be done without giving you the Scientific reasoning behind it. Most probably because those books expect me to trust and follow their suggestions as if the books are written by God. I had the same skeptical thoughts when I was suggested this book by my psychiatrist. He said itâ€™ll help me in my mental condition. Since I was desperate to get out of my fucked up mind, I decided to give it a go. I have to say, I liked this book, and will recommend it to other people.</p>

<p>The book contains 10 chapters</p>
